The Attendance is taken using Finger-print module. Admin will get the details of the absentees daily through Gmail. As RFID technology evolves, more sophisticated applications will use the capability of RFID to receive, store and forward data to a remote sink source. The versatility of RFID can be used in implementing functional and automatic student course attendance recording system that allows students to simply fill their attendance just by swiping or moving their ID cards over the RFID reader which are located at the entrance of lecture halls with a considerable degree of success and acceptability of usage in our faculty. Such an RFID based attendance system can shift the paradigm of studentâ€™s lecture attendance monitoring in classroom and provide a new, accurate, and less cumbersome way of taking student attendance in school. This project is a full system for student monitoring in colleges, and high education institutes. The device is supported with friendly using software for data analysis and previewing. Lectures need no more wasting time, and effort to have their Attendance Register. Attendance Register now, easily uploaded to Database. The proposed system is user- friendly, reliable and time saving.
